# AliceGL
### The new graphics API for magical girls

## Wait... what?

Yes, it's AliceGL! The API that won't probably bring peace to the everlasting
API war out there between Direct3D and OpenGL (mostly because it's just a mere
software rasterizer), but it might as well be nice to have around.

This thing is yet another of my learning projects, as part of AOS. Because I
recently started getting into working with low level graphics, and boy do I
love it.

However, I believe the best way to learn about something is to build your own
"version" of it from the ground up. Please do not expect AliceGL to be in any
way similar to OpenGL except on its (temporary) name. OpenGL is an awfully
designed API, although it's "less worse" than Direct3D anyway.

## So... how in the hell does this thing work?

Since apparently global mutable state (among other things) is a cancer, I'm
having a hard time figuring out how to implement this damn thing.

## Okay whatever... so... is it going to be FOSS?

Of course! And obviously under the nice permissive MIT license I like so much.
