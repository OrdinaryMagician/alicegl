AliceGL is pending yet another "from scratch" rewrite (no, seriously). This
time I WILL be sure to design things right. Stay tuned for more info.

I'm currently learning the ins and outs of software rasterization starting with
triangle drawing. Rather than design the API first and then start filling it up
bit by bit, it seems better to start small.
